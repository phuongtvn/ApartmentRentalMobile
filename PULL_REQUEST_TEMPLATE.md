### Business Requirements Update

To manage rooms, we need to implement the following screens:
1. **List View Screen**: This screen will display all available rooms with relevant details, allowing users to browse through the options.
2. **Detail Screen**: This screen will provide a more in-depth view of a selected room, including images, descriptions, and availability information.

These screens are crucial for enhancing user experience in managing room listings effectively.
